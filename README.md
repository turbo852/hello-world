Hi, my name is David Sellers.

I studied Computer Engineering at the University of Minnesota, but I haven't done much coding for a while and I'd like to sharpen my skills.

I am interested in video game design mostly, but would like to learn all sorts of things.
Lately, I've been interested in Python. Partly becuase of how easy it is, but also because it can be very powerful as well.

In my spare time, I do parkour an freerunning, play the ocarina, compose music, train for American Ninja Warrior, play video games, read, and work on video game ideas. A friend of mine is developing a game in Unity and I've been helping him with ideas for the game. Ocassionally, I have done some work in some local films doing stunts or being an extra.
